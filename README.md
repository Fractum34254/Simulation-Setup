# Simulation-Setup
Engine to create a new physics simulation for the Physics Simulation Engine.

This is the helper tool to create various physic simulations and execute them with my Physics Simulation Engine (on GitHub: 'Simulation' by @Fractum34254).
For more details read the README of the Engine (or just start this executable).
